The self-flip contain five steps.
first go up to some height which is useful for the next drop out;
then, accelerate to the maxmium target angle rate at some time;
third, hold the maxmium target angle for some time;
forth, decrease the target angle rate to zero;
fifth, recover to the position control, and find the origin point.

Notice: the most important thing is to calculate the every epsoide time, which will make
sure that the selp-filp success.
In fact, in case that the drone excess to the vertical state, it can approach to hover 
state and find the origin point by the position controller.

This simple thought is inspired by the paper wrote by ETH students, and the code has been
valided in the gazebo. 

I'm curious about the practical flight and hope for the success! Best wishes!
